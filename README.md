**Flight Management System**

This project provides a web-based flight management system for airlines, enabling efficient management and scheduling of flights, aircraft, and crew.

**Prerequisites**

- **Web Server:** This system requires a web server environment to run. Popular choices include Apache (XAMPP) or Nginx (WAMP).
- **MySQL Database:** A MySQL database is necessary to store flight data, aircraft information, and crew details.

**Installation**

1. **Install a Web Server:**
   - If you don't have one already, download and install a web server stack like XAMPP or WAMPP. Follow their respective installation guides.

2. **Start Web Server Services:**
   - Open the XAMPP/WAMP control panel and ensure the Apache and MySQL services are running.

3. **Clone the Project:**
   - Open a Git Bash or terminal window and navigate to your desired project directory (e.g., `cd C:\xampp\htdocs`).
   - Clone the project from the GitHub repository using the following command:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/HeyAryaHere/airline
     ```

4. **Extract Files (Optional):**
   - If you prefer not to use Git, you can download the project ZIP file from GitHub and extract it manually into your web server's document root directory (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs`).

5. **Create a MySQL Database:**
   - Open your web browser and access the phpMyAdmin administration panel (usually at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).
   - Click on "New" in the sidebar navigation.
   - Enter a database name (e.g., `airline`) and click "Create".

6. **Import Database Schema:**
   - Click on the newly created database (e.g., `airline`).
   - Navigate to the "Import" tab.
   - Click "Browse" and select the `airline.sql` file located within the project directory (`airline/airline.sql`).
   - Click "Go" to import the database schema.

**Access the System:**

- Open your web browser and navigate to: `http://localhost/airline/signin.html`

**Additional Notes**

- **Configuration:** Depending on your web server setup, you might need to adjust configuration files for database connections or other settings. Refer to your web server's documentation for guidance.
- **Security:** This is a basic setup for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, implement appropriate security measures to protect your database and application.
- **Further Development:** The GitHub repository ([https://github.com/topics/airline-management-system](https://github.com/topics/airline-management-system)) might not be actively maintained. Consider exploring alternative open-source flight management systems or collaborating with the project owner to enhance its functionality.

**Disclaimer:**

This README is based on the information provided and might require adjustments depending on the specific web server and MySQL versions you're using. Consider referring to the official documentation of your chosen web server stack for detailed installation and configuration instructions.
